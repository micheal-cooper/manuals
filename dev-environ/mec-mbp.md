## Using LiveReload with Chrome and Sublime Text Editor on Markdown Documents

1. Start LiveReload OSX Application.
1. Open Sublime Text Editor to an  '*.md' file.
2. Open Command Palette with 'Shift+Cmd+P'.
3. 'MarkdownPreview: Preview in Browser'.
4. In Chrome, click the 'Enable LiveReload' icon and make sure the dot in the center is filled in. This means Chrome is waiting for messages from the LiveReload application in OS X.
5. Edit and save. You might have to save twice to sometimes, but the browser should update with each save.
